#[Zipline: Build a Pomodoro Clock](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-pomodoro-clock)

This is my take on one of [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)'s Ziplines, specifically the one mentioned in the huge headline above.
The base project was written by [me](https://lutic.org/) and [Emil Aasa](https://github.com/emilaasa), although this repo will only contain my changes and additions.

A not necessarily up to date version can be found on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ahstro/full/YyKmJJ/).
